  SwitchDebounce.ino
  For ESP32_S2 boards
  Written by Khoi Hoang

  The ESP32-S2 has two timer groups, each one with two general purpose hardware timers. All the timers are based on 64 bits
  counters and 16 bit prescalers. The timer counters can be configured to count up or down and support automatic reload
  and software reload. They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by the software. The value
  of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
  unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one ESP32-S2 timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

  Based on SimpleTimer - A timer library for Arduino.

/*
   Notes:
   Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
   Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
   variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
   the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
   When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
   if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
   If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
   or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.

   Switch Debouncing uses high frequency hardware timer 50Hz == 20ms) to measure the time from the SW is pressed,
   debouncing time is 100ms => SW is considered pressed if timer count is > 5, then call / flag SW is pressed
   When the SW is released, timer will count (debounce) until more than 50ms until consider SW is released.
   We can set to flag or call a function whenever SW is pressed more than certain predetermined time, even before
   SW is released.
